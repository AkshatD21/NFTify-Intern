# Dex Screener API Integration Website

Welcome to the Dex Screener API Integration WebApp repository! In this project, you've built a user interface that interacts with the Dex Screener API to inform users about tokens and pairs. Below is a summary of your project.

## Project Overview

- This Website integrates with the [Dex Screener API](https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/tokens/:tokenAddreses) to fetch token and pair information.

- The [API Reference](https://docs.dexscreener.com/api/reference) was a valuable resource during development.

- The tech stack used for this project includes:
  - ReactJS for building the user interface.
  - Vanilla CSS for custom styling.
  - Tailwind CSS library to enhance the styling and layout.

- All data presented on the Website is sourced from the Dex Screener API. User input fetches and displays relevant data, creating a dynamic user experience.

- The Website allows users to search for pairs/token addresses and displays results accordingly.

- To optimize user experience, data for a maximum of 10 pairs is shown. The displayed pairs are sorted in descending order of price in USD.
